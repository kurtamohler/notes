    "I happened to find a video made by Prof. Eric Laithwaite, who was involved in inventing maglev train technology. In one of his demonstrations, he shows a DC electromagnet that seems to be able to do what I want: <https://youtu.be/OI_HFnNTfyU?t=199>\n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing this I thought it probably was possible to make the electromagnet that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laithwaite's electromagnet is strong enough to push a permanent magnet several inches across a table. It's also strong enough to pick up a heavy iron bar on contact. I estimate that the iron bar weighs around 3-6 lbs. So I'm willing to bet that this electromagnet is more than capable of what I want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The professor shows that if he takes out the iron core, the electromagnet becomes much weaker, demonstrating how important a ferromagnetic core really is. None of the electromagnets I've built so far have utilized a ferromagnetic core properly. At the time, I didn't understand magnetostatics well enough to even be sure that I needed a metal core. I did briefly try to use a screw as a core, but I recently realized that the metal in that screw is only barely ferromagnetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laithwaite's electromagnet runs on about 1.5 A, which isn't a huge amount. My UPS can give that much current, so I may be able to get something within a similar order of magnitude of strength. Although I can't be sure how much voltage his coil requires, so I don't know its power requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't plan to simply copy Laithwaite's exact setup. Of course I don't even know all the parameters of his setup. But further, I don't think his design is optimal or even meant to be optimal. I'd like to see how small I can make the electromagnet while generating the field strength that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my previous attempts, I have read through the magnetostatics chapers of the Griffiths book a few times, thought through the logic, worked some of the problems, and let it bake in my head.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe I now understand all the required theory to build a pretty good model of an electromagnet so that I can tune its parameters and optimize a design."

    "The core needs to be made of a material with high permeability and low coercivity.\n",

In other words, it is the range of possible internal magnetic field strengths $B$ that the material could possibly produce when $H=0$. So the lower the coercivity, the more linear and reversible the relationship between $B$ and $H$ will be.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I also considered checking out the two metal scrapyards near my house, but I imagine I would have no way of knowing the exact content of most of their scraps, so the magnetic properties would basically be unknown until I actually test them out. Also, if I wanted to make multiples of the same magnet, I'd probably be out of luck if I'm relying on scrap supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I've found, an accessible and relatively cheap option with pretty good magnetic properties is 1018 cold rolled steel, which can be bought from [Metal Supermarkets](https://www.metalsupermarkets.com/product/mild-steel-round-bar-cold-rolled-1018/) in cylinders of a specified diameter and length. This will certainly be suitable for me, so I'm going with it for now unless I find something even better later on."

But now imagine that one of the cores has a cylindrical radius 10 times the other. The volume of the larger core is about $\\pi 10^2 \\approx 300$ times greater than the smaller one, so at a distance, the field strength will be around 300 times greater.\n",
