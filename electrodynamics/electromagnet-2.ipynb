    "I happened to find a video made by Prof. Laithwaite, who was an engineer involved in inventing maglev train technology. In one of his demonstrations, he shows a DC electromagnet that seems to be able to do what I want: <https://youtu.be/OI_HFnNTfyU?t=199>\n",
    "\n",
    "After seeing this I knew it was possible to make the electromagnet that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laithwaite's electromagnet is strong enough to push a permanent magnet several inches across a table. It's also strong enough to pick up a heavy iron bar on contact. The iron bar probably weighs something on the order of 3-6 lbs, given the density of iron and my estimation of the dimensions of the bar. So I'm willing to bet that this electromagnet is more than capable of what I want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The professor shows that if he takes out the iron core, the electromagnet becomes much weaker, demonstrating how important a ferromagnetic core really is. None of the electromagnets I've built so far have utilized a ferromagnetic core properly. At the time, I didn't understand magnetostatics well enough to even be sure that I needed a metal core.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laithwaite's electromagnet runs on about 1.5 A, which isn't a huge amount. My UPS can easily give 0.9 A, so I should be able to get something within the same order of magnitude of stregth. Although I can't be sure how much voltage he gave to the coil.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't plan to simply copy Laithwaite's exact setup. Of course I don't even know all the parameters of his setup. But further, I don't think his design is meant to be optimal. I'd like to see how small I can make the electromagnet while generating the field strength that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my previous experiments, I have read through the magnetostatics chapers of the Griffiths book a few times, thought through the logic, worked some of the problems, and let it bake in my head.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe I now understand all the required theory to build a pretty good model of an electromagnet so that I can tune its parameters and optimize a design."

    "The basic idea is to pass a current through a wire to generate a magnetic field, and we'll use that wire's field to magnetize a piece of ferromagnetic metal. The field generated by that magnetized metal will be significantly stronger than the wire's field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, according to [this magnetization curve plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetization_curves.svg), if we apply an externally generated field of $H = 10 \\text{ A/inch}$ to a piece of either cast iron or nickel, the metal will produce a field of about $B = 0.3 \\text{ T}$.
