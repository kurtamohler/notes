(Without the stick, the top magnet would have six degrees of freedom, three rotation and three position, and the stationary magnet on the bottom wouldn't be sufficient to stabilize it.) The top magnet bounces up and down like a spring if you press it all the way down and release it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I thought, wouldn't it be cool to replace the bottom magnet with an electromagnet? That way, I can control the strength of the field pushing the top magnet to make it move up and down. If I make it look nice, it could be an interesting electronic art piece."

Since I want to replace the bottom magnet with an electromagnet, I'll need to make sure the electromagnet I design is as strong as the permanent magnet, so I need to somehow quantify the strength of the magnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to take some real world measurements. I have two ring magnets that both weight about 17 g. When I stack them opposed through a vertical stick, the equilibrium height is about 21 mm, measured from the bottom side of both magnets. The magnets have an outer radius of 15 mm, inner radius of 6 mm, and cylindrical height of 6 mm."

    "I assume that the fields generated by these permanent magnets can be approximated with the fields generated by two current loops. This is only an approximation, but it should be able to give a roughly similar magnetic field within an order of magnitude, if we pick good parameters for the current loops. Let's say the bottom magnet is now \"loop 1\" and the top magnet is \"loop 2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Both current loops have radius $R$, equal and opposite currents $I_1 = I $ and $I_2 = -I$ so that the magnetic poles are opposed, mass $m$, and axes aligned vertically with a height of $l$ between them. Let's say that $I_1$ is counterclockwise in the xy-plane, and $I_2$ is clockwise. The bottom loop is in a fixed position with its center at the origin, and the top loop is levitating in the air with its center at $l \\hat z$. There is no one obvious choice for $R$, but for now, let's say that $R = (15 + 6) / 2 = 10.5$ mm, the average of the inner and outer radii of the ring magnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the task is to find the current required to exert enough magnetic force on loop 2 to counter the gravitational force. One way to find the magnetic force on loop 2 is to first find the magnetic field, $\\mathbf B_1(\\mathbf r_2)$, generated by loop 1 at all positions $\\mathbf r_2$ within loop 2. Then we can apply the Lorentz force law to find the magnetic force on loop 2 due to the magnetic field of loop 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we could calculate $\\mathbf B_1$ with the Biot-Savart law. But I've tried this, and the integral it gives is too complicated for me--I have no idea how to solve it analytically. Fortunately, there is another helpful approximation we can make."

    "#### Infinite line current approximation for $l \\ll R$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two loop currents are very close to each other, $l \\ll R$, then the strength of the magnetic field $B_1(\\mathbf r_2)$ generated by loop 1 is approximately equal to the magnetic field a finite distance $l$ away from an infinite line current. You can think about it like this: if we zoom in very closely to a particular section of the two loops, it will start to look like the loops are two straight parallel lines that continue forever. This is much like the fact that the Earth looks like an infinite flat plane to a person standing on the surface, even though it's actually spherical--if Earth has radius $R$ and your height is $l$, with $l \\ll R$, the surface of the Earth is approximately an infinite flat plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very important to note that from our measurements of the real world case of the two permanent magnets, the magnets were actually much farther apart than this. In fact, $l \\gt R$ for the $R$ we chose. However, in order to levitate a magnet to a large distance, we first need to be able to levitate it to a short distance. So this approximation is useful--it will give us a good minimum current requirement to at least levitate the magnet to a short distance."
