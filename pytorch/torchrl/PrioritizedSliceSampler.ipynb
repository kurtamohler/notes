    "I need to improve the performance of `PrioritizedSliceSampler._padded_indices`. This function is fairly simple. it is given an `arange` tensor (values from 0 to N-1) and another tensor `shapes`, which contains a list of positive integers whose sum is supposed to equal the number of elements in `arange`. The output is supposed to break the `arange` up into groups according to the numbers in `shapes`. If the size of a particular group is smaller than the largest group, it is supposed to be filled with padding values of `-1` at the beginning of its row in the output.\n",
